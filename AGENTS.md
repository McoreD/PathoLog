# Agent Rules

- Always summarize code changes in the final response, and use that summary when performing `git push` after each code update.

## Semantic Versioning

- Use semantic versioning for all versioned artifacts: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.
- MAJOR: breaking changes to public APIs, data contracts, or user-visible behavior.
- MINOR: backward-compatible features or enhancements.
- PATCH: backward-compatible bug fixes or small corrections.
- Pre-release and build metadata follow SemVer 2.0.0 conventions.

## Purpose

- This document provides clear operating instructions for LLM-assisted work in this repository.

## Scope

- Applies to documentation, code, tests, configs, and release notes.
- If a request conflicts with repository guidelines, ask for clarification.

## Communication

- Be concise and factual.
- Prefer short paragraphs and bullet lists.
- Use consistent terminology from existing docs.

## Repository Awareness

- Read existing docs before adding new guidance.
- Avoid duplicating information unless it is a deliberate summary.
- Keep instructions in ASCII unless the target file already uses Unicode.

## Change Safety

- Do not remove or rewrite unrelated content.
- Do not change version numbers unless explicitly requested.
- Flag assumptions clearly when requirements are ambiguous.

## Code and Config Changes

- Follow existing patterns in each project area.
- Keep changes minimal and targeted.
- Add small comments only when necessary to explain non-obvious logic.

## Testing

- If you modify executable code, suggest relevant tests.
- If tests are added, align them with current test conventions.

## Documentation

- Update or add docs when behavior or usage changes.
- Keep filenames and headings descriptive and stable.

## Security and Privacy

- Do not include secrets or tokens.
- Avoid logging sensitive data in examples.

## Output Format

- For changes, summarize what changed and where.
- Provide next steps only when they are natural and actionable.
